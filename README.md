### Coffee and Tobacco in Enbesa
This mod enables you to plant Coffee and Tobacco in Enbesa and modifies the Coffee Production chain.
Coffee and Tobacco fertility are distributed on Enbesan Islands at the Game Start. So if you want the fertility on the whole island, you have to start a new game.

**If you don't want to start a new game**, you can use items to provide fertilities on your island. Those items can be bought at Ketemas harbour.
**OR** you use the Research Institute to change the fertilities of the Islands.
**OR** you can use the Anden Set from my botanical garden in Enbesa mod to get the Tobacco fertility and the Enchanted Set to get the coffee fertility.

I modified the Coffee Production chain to use Cotton Fabric for NW and Linen Cloth for Enbesa as a way to show that the coffee is packed up in sacks before export to make it a little bit more difficult to spam Coffee.

There are four versions:
* Normal version with Coffee Roaster requiring linen or cotton cloth respectively.
* Light version where the Coffee Roasters in Enbesa use linen cloth only.
* Super Light version where Coffee Roasters are not altered at all.
* Farms Only. Does what it says on the label.
